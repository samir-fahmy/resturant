# Metaflow

Metaflow is a human-friendly Python/R library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow was originally developed at Netflix to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.

For more information, see [Metaflow's website](https://metaflow.org) and [documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Metaflow. Please see our [contribution guide](https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/contributing-to-metaflow) for more details.

### Code style

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a code formatter. The easiest way to ensure your commits are always formatted with the correct version of `black` it is to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): install it and then run `pre-commit install` once in your local copy of the repo.
